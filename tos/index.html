                        <li>I reserve the right to decline/cancel and refund a commission for any reason and at any time.
                        <li>I reserve the right to decline requests to edit the piece after the final image has been given to you.
                        <li>I reserve the right to decline refunds of finished works.
                        <li>All copyrights of my artwork, ideas, and creative products remain with me. This means that…

                                <li>I reserve the right to post and use any commissioned artwork that I have created.
                                <li>You MAY NOT copy, redistribute, or alter my work without explicit permission from me, or claim my work as your own, nor are you allowed to remove my signature from the piece, should it be present.
                                <li>You MAY NOT duplicate my work with an intent to distribute, commercial or otherwise, unless agreed upon.
                                <li>You MAY duplicate the work that you’ve commissioned for your own non-commercial purposes or upload my work to social media/art blogs/etc. as long as you do not claim credit for the work and it remains unaltered.

                    <h1>Refund/Edit Policy</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I do not offer refunds after the final, full-sized image has been sent to you.
                        <li>I do offer full refunds up to the version of the image with the decided sketch. Depending on how far I have progressed after that, I will request to keep a portion or all of the payment as compensation for my time.
                        <li>If I have to cancel your commission for personal reasons, I will offer you a full refund, as well as the unfinished image document.
                        <li>Minor edits such as color and atmosphere are free of charge within reason. I can also provide simple edits such as monochromatic borders or simple Photoshop filters upon request for free as well.
                        <li>If you wish to request a major change or addition to the piece (i.e. new background or figure, etc…), I may ask for additional payment depending on the complexity of the edit. General rule of thumb is that the earlier you ask in the commission process, the less it will cost.
