#Refund/Edit
* I do not offer refunds after the final, full-sized image has been sent to you
* I do offer full refunds up to the version of the image with the decided sketch. Depending on how far I have progressed after that, I will request to keep a portion or all of the payment as compensation for my time
* If I have to cancel your commission for personal reasons, I will offer you a full refund, as well as the unfinished image document
* Minor edits such as color and atmosphere are free of charge within reason. I can also provide simple edits such as monochromatic borders or simple Photoshop filters upon request for free as well
* If you wish to request a major change or addition to the piece (i.e. new background or figure, etc...), I may ask for additional payment depending on the complexity of the edit. General rule of thumb is that the earlier you ask in the commission process, the less it will cost.
