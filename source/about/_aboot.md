#Pencil-Wielding Cat
When I was four, I picked up a pencil and drew a circle that vaguely resembled a mouse. My mom thought the drawing was impressive enough for me to be promptly enrolled in art lessons … and here I am.

I like to draw. When I’m not drawing, I can sometimes be found laughing at funny things on the internet.

I am a student currently attending the University of Denver as a Visual Art and Environmental Science major with dreams of becoming a (scientific) illustrator.
