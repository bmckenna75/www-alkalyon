# www-cercat
friend's website I'm designing

#Todo:
* Template it and build using [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) (makes it easier for non-html/css literate people to update, too)
* * move content into their own files and have the rest of the site templated for ease of building
* Move some links around (TOS to bottom bar)
