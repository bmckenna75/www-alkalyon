# www-cercat
friend's website I'm designing

#Todo:
* Add content

# Updating 
* to add an image to the gallery, place the image in `source/images/[traditional|digital]/` and then edit `/data/gallery.json` accordingly.
* To edit a page's text, edit the corresponding `.md` file in the source folder. That's where all text should be stored eventually.
* To edit the navbar, look at `/data/nav.json`
* Same goes for projects.
